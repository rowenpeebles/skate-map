It was originally built in 2005 and is mostly a tarmac surfaced wide mellow banked area with a four sided pyramid funbox in the centre and some ledges / rails. An additional concrete teardrop / spine and curved ledge on top of one of the banks were added circa 2020. In early 2022 a new concrete jump box, quarterpipe extension and metal flatbar rail were added and the base of the pyramid funbox resurfaced to make it smoother. You're probably not going to take a trip to Orkney just to skate this but it's Scotland's 2nd most northerly park and it's great to see that it is regularly used and has had some new features added in recent years, it would definitely be worth checking out if you're on holiday in Orkney!",

        "description": "The ‘Transport’ spot at the Riverside Museum in Glasgow came out of a conversation Glasgow Museums had in 2017 with Jamie Blair at Clan Skates. Given they present an exhibit that features Jamie and Colin Kennedy they couldn’t very well pass a ban at the front of their building when issues around skating arose, even less so because the ledges out the front were (rather poorly) designed with skating in mind. The resulting conflict of use at the museum's entrance led them to find a way to welcome skaters that didn’t clash with the general public (You CAN still skate the ledges, just do so when the museum is closed after 5pm). Following initial discussions Jamie approached Glasgow Urban Sports, a charity that’s been working longterm on developing new terrain in Glasgow, to help formulate some ideas for using the very limited budget available to build more skateable stuff in a less prominent part of the site. With the support of our GUS colleagues Neil Davidson and Angus McPhee and the enthusiastic input of Youngo and the crew at Concreate Skateparks, Raydale Dower and I used our experience as skaters and artists to develop a plan that might make a spot rather than a skatepark. The idea was to make it feel like a legit street spot despite featuring purpose built elements and we did this by trying to modify the museum's existing hard landscaping rather than imposing a ‘facility’ on the site. We wanted to match materials and make the space flow in a way that meant non-skaters might not even register the changes we were making. The result is a hybrid space for shared use; a mix of public thoroughfare, skate spot, hangout zone and even scenic barbecue location. We wanted it to be a complementary counterpoint to Kelvingrove and it's turned out to be a significant addition to the scene in Glasgow and a draw for visiting skaters too. All this was achieved in a matter of months on a sub £15k budget because we had a willing partner/landowner in Glasgow Museums, a committed and flexible contractor and an innovative yet frugal vision for the site. Hopefully it can act as an inspiration for other local authorities and statutory bodies as it proves you don’t need hundreds of thousands of pounds and years of toil to create something that skaters will enjoy.",

The bowl is like a cereal bowl, it is a perfect circle and quite mellow. There are some other small obstacles there but are in various states of disrepair - not that there was much there to begin with anyway. This place is sometimes referred to as 'Cranhill Mini ramp' and their is indeed a halfpipe, however, this is a roll-in halfpipe on a hill! More like an American-style storm drain like in the videos. Note: definitely not worth travelling to visit but included here for the sheer novelty and weirdness factor.",

A concrete construction with plastic / wood combo ramps. 1 x Funbox, 3 mellow flatbanks with poor lips between concrete and ramp. Grindbox runs down one side of this box. 1 x manual / grindbox, around 5 meters long and about half a meter high. 1 x Flatbank, reasonable incline - runs on to the funbox. 1 x Quarter pipe. This completes the run from flatbank to grindbox. Poor lip between concrete and ramp. Around 4-5 feet high. The park is situated next to a kids park, has no bins, is fairly basic and not worth a trip to unless you're in the area.",
